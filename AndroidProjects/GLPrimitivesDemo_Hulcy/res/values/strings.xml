    <string name="gl_points">Treats each vertex as a single point. Vertex n defines point n. N points are drawn.</string>
	<string name="gl_lines">Treates each pair of vertices as an	independent line segment. Vertices 2n-1 and 2n define	line n.	 N/2 lines are drawn.</string>
	<string name="gl_line_strip">Draws a connected group of line segments from the first vertex to the	last. Vertices n and n+1 define line n. N-1 lines are drawn.</string>
	<string name="gl_line_loop">Draws a connected group of line segments from the first vertex to the last, then back	to the first.  Vertices	n and n+1 define line n. The last line, however, is defined by vertices N and 1. N lines are drawn.</string>
	<string name="gl_triangles">Treates each triplet of vertices as	an independent triangle. Vertices 3n-2, 3n-1, and 3n define triangle n.N/3 triangles are drawn.</string>
	<string name="gl_triangle_strip">Draws a connected group of triangles. One triangle is defined for each vertex presented after the	first two vertices. For odd n, vertices	n, n+1,	and n+2	define triangle	n. For even n, vertices n+1, n, and n+2 define triangle n. N-2 triangles are drawn.</string>
	<string name="gl_triangle_fan">Draws a connected group of triangles. One triangle is defined for each vertex presented after the first two vertices. Vertices 1, n+1, and n+2 define triangle n. N-2 triangles are drawn.</string>
